## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salakoayoola/eagle-eye.git
cd eagle-eye
./install.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATA_DIR to your storage root
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## Architecture

```
Eagle Eye (React + shadcn/ui)    ← Frontend (Nginx Proxy)
Unified Backend (Hono + Node.js) ← File Ops + Drive Management
```

- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Sonner (Notifications)
- **Backend:** Unified Hono server running natively on Node.js. 
- **File System:** Direct management using native `fs` modules and standard Linux utilities (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`).
- **Media Engine:** `exiftool` for RAW extraction and `ffmpeg` for video thumbnail generation.

## Media Preview Notes

- **RAW Images**: Uses `exiftool` to extract the high-res embedded preview, bypassing the need for expensive transcoding.
- **Cinema Formats**: Supports a wide array of professional codecs; if the browser can't play it natively, Eagle Eye provides a frame-accurate thumbnail and metadata.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EAGLE_EYE_PORT` | `8080` | Web interface port |
| `COMPANION_PORT` | `3924` | Unified Backend API port |
| `MEDIA_MOUNT_DIR` | `/mnt/media` | Host mount point for removable drives |

## Development

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

# Unified Backend
